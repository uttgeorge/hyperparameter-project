## Abstract
The project is a part of skunksworks hyperparameters project. First part is to create a database that stores the gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family, and second part is to store evalutions and hyperparameters that used to perform algorithms on mushroom data in part one.

## Explain Data Source
This dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository, including descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms 
in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American 
Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown 
edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states 
that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, 
let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
